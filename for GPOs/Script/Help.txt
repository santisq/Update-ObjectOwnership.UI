.SYNOPSIS
Updates the ACL Owner value of a Group Policy Container.

.DESCRIPTION
Validates all Group Policy Paths used as input, if the Path exists it will display Current and New Owner values for each one.

Default New Owner value is 'Domain Admins' however this can be changed if the new value is validated (Exists in the Current Domain).
Please, run this script with a high level permission account to avoid any errors. After processing the changes, all objects with status 'Ready to Process' should change to 'Updated'.

Ways to verify if the new Access Control List has been successfully updated:
   - Group Policy Management > Group Policy Objects > Select the GPO > Details
   - (Get-GPO -Guid <GPO ID>).Owner
   - (Get-Acl "AD:<GPO Path>").Owner

.INPUT
*.xlsx or *.csv file with a Column named 'Path'. All lines on this column will be validated against AD.
The recommended input is the output files generated by the Object Owners scripts (for GPOs in this case).

.OUTPUT
Log files of all the updated objects can be found on Logs folder in Script's root folder.
